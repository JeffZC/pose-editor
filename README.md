# Pose Editor: An Intuitive Tool for Human Pose Keypoint Refinement

Pose Editor is a user-friendly application for editing and refining human pose keypoint data, which bridges the gap between automated pose detection and human refinement, allowing users to manually adjust AI-generated keypoints that may be imprecise or incorrect. This versatile tool allows researchers, animators, and motion analysts to precisely correct and improve keypoints recognized by human pose estimation algorithms such as MediaPipe, OpenPose, etc.

## Key Features

- **Easy Video Navigation**: Browse through video frames with intuitive playback controls.
- **Interactive Pose Editing**: Click and drag keypoints directly on the video frame.
- **Black and White Toggle**: Switch between color and grayscale modes for better visibility.
- **Precise Coordinate Control**: Manually enter exact coordinates for perfect positioning.
- **Dynamic Zoom**: Zoom in for detailed edits and zoom out for full context.
- **Simple File Management**: Load videos, import existing pose data, and save your edited work with ease.

## Perfect For

- Motion analysis researchers
- Physical therapy assessment
- Sports performance analysis
- Computer vision dataset preparation
